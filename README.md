# ðŸ“š Stack Data Structure â€“ Implementations & Applications
- This repository contains **C/C++ implementations** of the **Stack** data structure and its most common applications.
- Stacks follow the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle â€” the last element added is the first one removed.
- We cover stack basics and real-world use cases like expression evaluation, parenthesis matching, and more.
